# Music-Player-App-20240904-P4-github.io
2024-2025 Development

Progressions
- [x] Practice creating and deleting repositories ( REMEMBER: github.io for hosting )
- [ ] Case Study: what does a music player interface look like with most of the buttons present
    - Demo: What would my buttons look like
    - Demo: where does my information go
    - Review video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMjozqJS44M
    - List of Buttons & Information (See DIVs), leads to prototyping buttons as a void (variable inputs comes from DIVs), purpose is working with size()-CANVAS
    - Image of Text, Images, and buttons: 100% activity, leads to paper folding activity ("Draw my pointillism"), purpose is developing mini-CANVAS's
    - List of Data: music MP4's, associated images, purpose is now where these images go
        - Review how to find information, know what is available
        - NOTE: Computers can see NULL and give information to user as a Try-Catch (CS30)
    - Final Case Studies "Booklet", purpose is sequence of images for website promotion answering who I am as a developer
        - "Where do I put the buttons", name separate images, upload to GitHub for reference and Website Hosting
        - Splash Screen & Welcome with Name, Enter, Preferences (in CS20 to be saved as Write-Read File, DIVs as preference buttons to change formats),
         Uses APIs in 20
        - AutoPlay Screen, one playList starts playing with minimalist interface (user defines minimalist and purpose of whitespace), 2 click to anything rule
        - Play List Screen, Buttons to interact with playlist like Loop-Play-List (this button can be included on previous), drag and drop, refresh
        - Single Song Screen, Buttons for single song, metadata information
    - Remedial Case Study:
        - AutoPlay Screen: Always on, MUTE & QUIT ( how to read a display, actually reading anything, then ID where important stuff is in "T",
         like a seating plan in a classroom)
            - NOTE: lower half of "One Screen" as a teaching tool, activate lines to see symmetry (1/2, 1/4, etc if necessary)
            - 10 Seconds: Stop - Previous - Loop ONCE - Next
            - Middle of Song: Stop - Reverse (Previous is double click) - Pause - Forward - Loop ONCE - Next
            - Last 20%: Stop - Previous - Reverse - Replay - Loop ONCE - Next
        - "Upper Half of "One Screen: my teaching screen, using images (easier not as valuable in learning)
    - Final Case vs. Remedial: students must demonstrate design of use, are buttons always on, how is screen spaces active or not
    - Remedial Splash Screen: single Boolean of entire screen, active the WINDOW in WINDOWS for Key Pressing (not mouse-pressing), OS Level hack
    - Due Dates: the day I teach it is the day it is due and must be done for HW (will be checked online or in person), must send email if missed

...


- [ ] Case Study: what do music buttons look like? Different Styles? Different Functions?
    - Introduce DIVs as lines to view symmetry (1/2, 1/4, etc if necessary)
    - Hover-over changes outline and shape colour
    - Booleans change Day, Dark, and Night Modes ( advanced: preferences CANVAS, otherwise CONSOLE accessed)
    - Math formulae about geometry (screen and shapes)
    - Remedial: Download one "square" play button image for tint() hover-over, who struggles with formulae and variable-cascading, leads to passing parameters
- [ ] Case Study: algorithms of music button features
- [ ] Prototype: individual buttons on CANVAS and through CONSOLE, one sound effect and one song

- [ ] Buttons
- [ ] CANVAS vs. CONSOLE

---

### Reviewing Minim Documentation
- Prototyping on KeyPressed, CANVAS, CONSOLE

DIVs: paper folding on different sized papers with ratios, draw after me in pointillism
- Introduce Primitive Variables: int v long, float v double, string v char
- CAUTION: one song only
- CAUTION: Single DIV only
- [ ] Buttons
   - Stop: creates the symmetry of all buttons
   - Play | AutoPlay
   - Pause
   - Fast Forward | includes Pause ? | Note: set time skip as seconds or percentage of song
   - Fast Reverse 
   - Next 
   - Previous
   - Loop, single song: once (1), infinite (sideways 8), set number of times (other number)
   - Loop PlayList
   - Shuffle (Cross with triangle ends)
   - Mute (speakers only)
   - Quit Button | Shape and Text | Sound Effect | "Are you Sure" Menu Reminder
- [ ] Music Load | Drag and Drop Feature
   - Introduce Arrays for Music Songs Only, Array List Out of Bounds, Try-Catch, Index
- [ ] Information
   - Display Song File, Name, Progess, Total Time, Other strings inside MetaData
   - Song Number in Play List
- [ ] Image

Prototyping Buttons: CANVAS, no mousePressed yet

Prototyping Buttons: Algorithms & CONSOLE
- Based on Song Playing: first 10 seconds, middle, last 20%

Building QUIT Button
- exit()
- double rect()
- hoverover features
- Play Button for Sound Effect, trimmed for effect

Assembling Music Player
- Require DIVs | All prototyped buttons basedon on DIVs, padding, square in DIV
- DIVs built on ratio of CANVAS to auto dimenstion DIVs
- AutoPlay
- Other Buttons

Advanced
- Button as an Image - Second Level of Music Player
- Reading Folder Files, Drag and Drop
- Playlist sorted according to most played song, decreasing in order, able to set in preference

# To Include

---

# Stories - Also See HardDrive
- My example demos how I reduce bugs through routine and input habits, may need words to ID, some can simply repeat patterns (data sets in teaching math or abstract ideas)
- Setting up computer station every class, time decreases to less than a minute, balanced with garbage, searing plans
    - Not North American way about computer stations, more youth way on legs, laying on floor, etc. not ergonomic 
    - Story of Hardware Guy trying to learn to buy groceries, outperforming AP Students on CISCO Exam ... we need people like this
- Everyone gets to demonstrating AP-Level coding project, exam and amount of information is separate issue
- Creating GitHub Repos: 100% activity, an exam or quiz is only going to assess who doesn't know,
it needs to be practiced, do it 10 times, then start assessing who knows
- Final Case Studies "Booklet": IDs students able to think in multiple variables mathematically or artistically and demonstrate, 
out is students who download "square" music buttons to be used with tint() (see Drawing Program, MEd student and Artist)
- ID those capable, ID those coachable, ID those who struggle and work with deeper issues (can someone every deal with this level of understanding a student)
- How does the use of remedial cases work guiding students to OOP, encouragement always, as a student I was discouraged ( how I give back ), I now understand
this as a person anxious or avoidant and how they pass on themselves to other generations
- COVID drastically interrupted all remedial work for complicated and complex reasons
- Becomes different class lists in a clipboard, marks transferred to Gradebook when needed
- Math Formulae about Geometry: in math geometry is about shapes and relationships about dimensions
(i.e. collisions and radii searching), geometry is also a computer term about a display (i.e. width and height), these do not match, reminds me the
divide between the Bools, Mary and Her Husband as interpreted by the people after them
- A display is an embodied metaphor, you can touch it. Concrete needs to be explored before abstract Objects in OOP

---

- DIVs, rect(), and parent interview (student apologized in grade 12)
    - What is current state of missed HW, assessment, redo's, and make-up grades
    - How can parents help vs. confronting teachers
    - student is one who knows and has responsibility, send email, help son-daughter send email
